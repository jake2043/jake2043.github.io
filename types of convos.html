<h2>When to Intervene</h2>

    <p>While these conversations may be challenging, it is necessary to address these behaviors for a healthy work enviornment. Very rarely do situations resolve themselves. Make sure to gauge when to intervene. If you jump right in, then you may be seen like a police officer, but if you wait too long then the issue may be a lot more complex to deal with.</p><br>

    <p>I know what you're thinkingâ€¦ How will I know when to intervene? The answer is: "it depends", but here are some things to consider to help you along the way: </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Do you complain about them nonstop?</b> This can be a sure fire way to know that you have an issue. While it is common to "vent", you may find yourself consistently complaining about this employee. This behavior is your soul telling you to "talk to the person about X" because complaining is a temporary solution to actually addressing the problem </li>
      <li><b>How long have you noticed this behavior has been going on?</b> You may want to see if there is any proof to the frequency and then review any other behaviors you may be noticing. This may help you gauge whether it is something you make note of and document or loosely test some assumptions on a 1-on-1 to help you in your determination. </li>
      <li><b>Is it harmful, disruptive, and unethical behavior, or a violation of company policy?</b> If so, these sort of conversations need to be addressed sooner rather than later. There will need to be some preparation. If it is something serious, seek help of your Human Resources, or Employee Relations department. </li>
    </ul><br><hr>

    <p><b>One thing to remember is: </b><br>
