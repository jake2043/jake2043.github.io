<p>After having a difficult conversation, managers should take several important steps to ensure that the conversation is followed up on effectively and that the desired outcomes are achieved. Here are some key actions managers should take:</p><br>

<img src="Image Assets/difficultbanners/followup.png" alt="Info Graphic outlining all steps to take after the conversation:

  1) Reflect on the conversation- Consider the employee's reactions, the effectiveness of your communication style, and whether the conversation achieved the desired outcomes.
  2) Monitor & Track Progress-Continuously monitor the employee's progress and performance in the discussed areas.
  3) Document it- Document the key points discussed during the conversation, including any agreed-upon action steps or expectations.
  4) Open Communication- If the employee raises any concerns or questions following the difficult conversation, be open and responsive.
  5) Provide Support and Resources-This could involve providing training opportunities, assigning a mentor/coach, or offering additional guidance and feedback.
  6) Maintain Confidentialty- Maintaining confidentiality helps build trust between the manager and the employee.
  7) Set Mileestones & Check-ins- Be specific, focusing on behaviors and actions, and offer suggestions for further growth.
  8) Evaluate Overall Impact- Are the desired outcomes being achieved? Are there any further steps needed to address ongoing challenges?
  9) Constructive Feedback- Acknowledge their efforts and progress, while also addressing any areas that still need improvement.
  10) Reflect on Personal Growth- Reflect on your own communication and leadership skills. Think about how you can continue to grow in this space." class="align-center" width="1300px"><br><br><hr>

<h2>Conclusion & Practice</h2>

<p>Navigating difficult conversations takes time and effort, but remember that tools like this are available to help you center your focus and, hopefully, navigate them a little better. Just as no two people are alike, neither are situations. It may be easy to try and handle similar situations in the same way, but you may lose sight of the person that you're helping to develop and grow. As you build your experience and toolkit, make sure to re-visit the basics and continue to identify the areas that you may struggle.</p>
