<h2>Ingredients</h2><br/>

<em>You want to premeasure the ingredients because the process moves quickly once the marshmallow mixture is ready. This will allow you to easily transition the finished treats to the baking pan to cool and set.</em><br/>

<h2>Rice Krispie Treats Ingredients</h2>

<ul style="list-style-type:none; padding-inline-start: 0px">
<li><b>6 cups of Rice Cereal-</b> I recommend Kellogg's&trade; for the standard classic, but you can use any brand, or sub out for Cocoa Krispies&trade;.</li>
<li><b>5 cups miniature marshmallows-</b> I recommend Jett-Puffed, but you want to go with fresh marshmallows if possible.</li>
<li><b>3 Tablespoons of Butter cut into smaller chunks-</b>  You can use salted or unsalted.</li>
<li><b>1 teaspoon of vanilla-</b> I like to use real vanilla.</li>
</ul><hr /><br />

<h2>Peanut Butter Chocolate Layer</h2>

<b>1 bag of peanut butter and chocolate chips-</b> I recommend Toll House&trade;<br /><br /><hr />

<h2>Rice Krispie Treat Equipment</h2>
 <ul style="padding-inline-start: 20px">
<li><b>Stove-</b>  You can use a microwave.</li>
<li><b>Deeper sauce pan or medium stock pot-</b> You want enough room to add all of the ingredients and deep enough to avoid flinging the ingredients outside of the pan as you stir.</li>
<li><b>Rubber Spatula-</b> Helps to stir the marshmallow and butter mixture.</li>
<li><b>Mixing spoon/wooden spoon-</b><i>(optional)</i>Sturdy for when you add and mix the cereal with the marshmallow mixture.</li>
<li><b>Measuring Cups</b></li>
<li><b>Measuring Spoons</b></li>
<li><b>Mixing Bowls-</b> Helps to hold the premeasured cereal and marshmallows.</li>
<li><b>Prep cups or containers-</b> To hold the premeasured butter and vanilla.</li>
<li><b>9x13 Baking pan-</b> You can choose a deeper smaller pan if you want thicker treats.</li>
<li><b>Parchment Paper-</b> This will line the pan and make it easy to pull treats. It makes for easier clean up. Alternately, you could grease the pan instead.</li><br />
</ul><hr /><br />

<h2>Peanut Butter Chocolate Layer Equipment</h2>
<ul style="padding-inline-start: 20px">
<li><b>Stove-</b>  You can use a microwave</li>
<li><b>Sauce Pan-</b> This will be used to heat the water to help melt the peanut butter chocolate chips.</li>
<li><b>Medium Heat Safe Bowl-</b> This could be a stainless steel bowl or glass. This will be used to melt the chocolate.</li>
<li><b>Rubber Spatula-</b> To stir and spread the chocolate mixture.</li>
<li><b>Oven Mitts-</b> This will help you to grab the bowl with the melted chocolate to pour over the rice krispie treats.</li>
</ul><hr /><br />

<h2>Rice Krispie Instructions</h2>
 <ol style="padding-inline-start: 20px">
<li>Make sure to have all of your equipment out and ingredients premeasured in your mixing/prep bowls.
<li>Line your baking pan with parchment paper.
<li>Add butter to the pan and then put over low heat stirring with the rubber spatula until melted.***<br /><br />
<b>Tip-</b> If you have the heat too high, you run the risk of overcooking the sugar in the marshmallow, which could lead to a crunchy treat. If you want them soft and gooey low and slow is the way to go!<br /><br>

<li>Once the butter is melted, add the marshmallows and stir until melted.</li>
<li>Once the marshmallow mixture is melted, shut off the heat.</li>
 <li>Add the vanilla and stir until mixed in.</li>
<li>Add the cereal to the mixture and change to the mixing spoon to stir until it is evenly coated with the marshmallow mixture.</li>
<li>Transfer the mixture to the parchment lined pan.</li>
<li>Use the spatula to spread evenly by lightly press the mixture around in the pan.</li><br/>
<b>Tip-</b> If you press too  firmly, your treats will be a little more dense.<br /><br />
</ol><br />
***If you want to use the microwave, you can do short time intervals and watch for when the butter is melted. Once you add your marshmallows, you can heat in shorter intervals 10-15 seconds, take it out and mix, and repeat until it is all melted and incorporated.<br /><br /><hr />

<h2>Peanut Butter Chocolate Layer</h2>
 <ol style="padding-inline-start: 20px">
<li>Fill the sauce pan 1/4 full of water. You don't want the water to touch bowl.</li>
<li>Empty bag of peanut butter chocolate chips into a heat safe bowl.</li>
<li>Place pan on the stove over medium heat and bring to a simmer.***</li><br />

<b>Tip-</b> If it begins to boil, lower the heat until it gets back down to the simmer.<br /><br />

<li>Place the heat safe bowl with the chips over the simmering water.</li>
<li>Stir constantly with spatula until melted.</li>
<li>Turn off the heat.</li>
<li>Using oven mitts, lift the bowl and pour the melted chips over the Rice Krispie treats.</li>
<li>Spread the peanut butter chocolate layer evenly over the treats with the spatula.</li>
<li>Leave out at room temperature and let everything cool for an hour, or until set.</li>
<li>Once cooled, pull out the treats using the parchment paper.</li>
<li>Cut and enjoy!</li>
 </ol><br />

***If you want to use the microwave to melt the chips, you can do short time intervals 10-15 seconds, take it out and stir, then repeat as needed until it is all melted.
