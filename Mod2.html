    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p> Hey everyone, my name is Jake Herrera and I live in Grand Rapids Michigan.
      This is my final course in the IDN program here at Quinnipiac University.
      It has been a fun and challenging ride, and I'm looking forward to enhancing
      my html coding skills in this course.</p>
      <h2> What I do</h2>
      <p>Currently, I'm a technical trainer for a regional bank, which means I work with
        small business and commercial customers to help them understand how to set-up and
        maximize the benefits of the different product solutions we offer such as electronic
        payments (ACH/Wire), Positive Pay, or check scanning. I also get the opportunity to create supplemental
      training documentation such as implementation guides or job aids</p>
      <h2> What I love</h2>
      <p>I love connecting with others in various ways whether it is through cooking a meal, planning an event, or conducting a learning event. I like to help set-up activities and keep things flowing.
      It is awesome when we're able to create learning events that allow our leanr's to access the content in a way that is meaningful and relevant to them.</p>
        <h2> What's Next?</h2>
          <p>I'd love to spend some time as an ID or learning consultant with an emphasis on the needs analysis and design aspect, but I'd
            also enjoy some light development opportunities (e.g. video, podcast, or elearning). After that, I'd love to work more on the development side
            and eventually move into management or perhaps try my hand at being an adjunct professor to lead similar courses. I hope to see myself partnering
            with nonprofits later on to help the underserved whether that be related to public health or Queer education.</p>
