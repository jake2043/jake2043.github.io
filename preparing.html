    <p>Preparation is the key to a successful conversation. Even if your normal approach is to normally "wing it", these conversations require some tact, especially when the other person isn't receptive to even having the conversation. You may want to be prepared for these sorts of reactions and what steps to take before diving right into the conversation.</p>

    <p>When having a conversation it is a two way street and there are a lot of variables to consider. To help you put your best foot forward you have to sometimes take a step back and take stock of the full situation. As you prepare for you conversation, think the following: </p><br>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Clarify the purpose and desired outcome:</b> Clearly define the purpose of the conversation and the desired outcome you want to achieve. Identify the specific issues or concerns that need to be addressed and determine the goals you want to accomplish through the conversation.</li>
      <li><b>Gather relevant information:</b> Collect all relevant information related to the situation at hand. This may include performance records, feedback from colleagues or customers, and any other supporting documentation. Having concrete examples and data will help provide a factual basis for the conversation.</li>
      <li><b>Reflect on your own emotions and biases:</b> It's essential to be aware of your own emotions and biases before entering a difficult conversation. Reflect on any personal biases you may have and try to approach the conversation with objectivity and fairness. Manage your emotions and ensure you are in the right mindset to have a constructive discussion.</li>
      <li><b>Put yourself in the employee's shoes:</b>Empathy is a crucial component of effective communication. Try to understand the employee's perspective and consider the factors that may be contributing to the situation. This will help you approach the conversation with empathy and a genuine desire to understand their point of view.</li>
      <li><b>Plan your communication approach:</b>Think about how you will communicate your concerns and expectations during the conversation. Consider the language you will use, the tone of your voice, and your body language. Aim to be clear, concise, and respectful in your communication style. It may help to map out the general structure or script a potential flow. This could look something like: </li><br><br>

      <b>I'd like to talk about: </b>Your recent behavior during the last few team meetings.<br><br><br>

      <b>The reason why is: </b>I want to check in with you to find out your perspective.<br><br><br>

      <b>What I've noticed:</b>Is that you’ve been rolling your eyes when myself or others share information and you’re sitting arms crossed and sunk into the chair.<br><br><br>

      <b>I perceive:</b>Based on these actions you may have more share or disagree with recent changes and I’m also concerned that these actions might come across as disrespectful.<br><br><br>

      <b>Ask Them: </b>What are your thoughts? Or walk me through what's happening?<br><br><br>

      <b>What I need/want:</b> From you is to feel comfortable sharing your feelings and to be a little more aware of how your non-verbal cues may come across to others.<br><br><br>

      <b>Would you be willing to?:</b> Be more aware of these reactions and attempt to communicate those feelings in a more conductive way such as speaking up, sharing them on one-on-ones, or whatever communication style works best for you?<br><br><br>

      <b>Would you be willing to?:</b> Be more aware of these reactions and attempt to communicate those feelings in a more conductive way such as speaking up, sharing them on one-on-ones, or whatever communication style works best for you?<br><br><br>

      <li><b>Anticipate potential reactions:</b>Consider how the employee might react during the conversation. Anticipate their possible emotions, concerns, or resistance. By preparing for potential reactions, you can better navigate the conversation and be prepared to respond appropriately. Note- check out the Approaches Employees Might Use section above.</li>
      <li><b>Develop a structure for the conversation:</b>Plan the structure and flow of the conversation to ensure a productive discussion. Start with an opening statement that sets a positive tone, express your concerns and observations, and then provide specific examples to support your points. Encourage the employee to share their perspective and actively listen to their responses.</li>
      <li><b>Determine possible solutions and next steps:</b>Think about potential solutions or actions that can address the issues discussed during the conversation. Consider any support or resources that may be required to help the employee improve or overcome challenges. Be prepared to discuss and agree upon actionable steps or a performance improvement plan, if necessary.</li>
      <li><b>Practice active listening: </b>Active listening is key to fostering understanding and engagement. Practice active listening skills, such as maintaining eye contact, nodding, and summarizing key points. This demonstrates that you value their input and encourages open dialogue.</li>
      <li><b>Schedule an appropriate time and setting:</b>Choose a suitable time and setting for the conversation that provides privacy and minimizes distractions. Ensure there is ample time available for the conversation without interruptions, allowing for an unhurried and focused discussion.</li>
    </ul><br>
    <p>Remember, each conversation is unique, and it's important to adapt your approach based on the individual and circumstances involved. By adequately preparing, leaders can create a conducive environment for open and respectful dialogue, increasing the chances of a positive outcome.</p><br>

    <p>One of the many tips above ask that you anticipate the potential reaction of the employee, but in the moment it isn't always easy to develop an approach on the spot! <i>Luckily</i>, there is a chart below with some common reactions and suggested approaches.</p><br><br>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Common Reactions</th>
          <th>Suggeested Approaches</th>
        </tr>

          <td>Employees may try to avoid the conversation altogether by deflecting, changing the subject, or withdrawing from the discussion.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Defensiveness:</b>Some employees may become defensive during difficult conversations as a way to protect themselves or deflect responsibility.</td>
          <td>To address defensiveness, approach the conversation with empathy and understanding. Validate their perspective and express that your intention is to find a resolution rather than assign blame. Focus on discussing behaviors and specific situations rather than attacking the individual.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Denial or minimization</b>Some employees may become defensive during difficult conversations as a way to protect themselves or deflect responsibility.</td>
          <td>To overcome denial or minimization, provide specific examples and evidence to support your points. Help the employee understand the consequences of their actions or behavior and the importance of addressing the issue for personal and professional growth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Emotional reactions:</b>Difficult conversations can evoke strong emotions, and employees may respond with anger, tears, or other emotional reactions.</td>
          <td>To handle emotional reactions, remain calm and composed. Validate their emotions and give them space to express themselves, but also steer the conversation back to the main issue at hand. Encourage them to express their thoughts and concerns in a constructive manner.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Blame shifting:</b>Employees may attempt to shift blame onto others or external factors rather than taking responsibility for their actions.</td>
          <td>To address blame shifting, stay focused on the specific issue and maintain a fact-based discussion. Ask open-ended questions that encourage self-reflection and personal accountability. Help the employee understand their role in the situation and the importance of taking ownership.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><b>Resistance to feedback:</b>Employees may resist or reject feedback during difficult conversations, refusing to acknowledge or accept their areas for improvement.</td>
          <td> To overcome resistance, provide specific examples and objective data to support your feedback. Focus on the impact their behavior or actions have on their own performance or the team. Offer solutions or suggestions for improvement and engage them in problem-solving.</td>
        </tr>
